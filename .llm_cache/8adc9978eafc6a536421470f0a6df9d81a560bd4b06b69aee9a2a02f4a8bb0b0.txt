Based on the problem statement and the reference test patch, we need to create a test that checks if the `__dict__` attribute exists for a `Symbol` instance and if it can be modified. The test should fail if the `__dict__` attribute exists or can be modified, as `Symbol` instances are supposed to be immutable.

Here is the test diff:

```diff
diff --git a/sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py b/sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py
--- a/sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py

And here is the updated `.ta_split.json`:

```json
{
  "public": [
    "sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py::test_symbol_immutable"
  ],
  "hidden": []
}
```

This test checks if the `__dict__` attribute exists for a `Symbol` instance and if it can be modified. The test should fail if the `__dict__` attribute exists or can be modified, as `Symbol` instances are supposed to be immutable. This test reproduces the bug described in the problem statement.
