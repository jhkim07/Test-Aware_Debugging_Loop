Based on the problem statement and the reference test patch, we need to create a test that checks if the `__dict__` attribute exists for a `Symbol` instance. The test should fail if the attribute exists, as it should not be present according to the problem statement.

The test will be added to the `sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py` file, following the structure of the reference test patch. The test will create a `Symbol` instance and assert that it does not have a `__dict__` attribute.

Here is the test diff:

```diff
diff --git a/sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py b/sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py
--- a/sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py

The `.ta_split.json` file will be updated to include the new test in the `public` section:

 }
```

This test will fail on the buggy code because the `__dict__` attribute exists for `Symbol` instances, and it will pass after the bug is fixed.
