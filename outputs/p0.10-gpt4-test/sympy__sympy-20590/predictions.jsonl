{"instance_id": "sympy__sympy-20590", "model_patch": "Based on the problem statement and the reference test patch, we need to create a test that checks if the `__dict__` attribute exists for a `Symbol` instance. The test should fail if the attribute exists, as it should not be present according to the problem statement.\n\nThe test will be added to the `sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py` file, following the structure of the reference test patch.
