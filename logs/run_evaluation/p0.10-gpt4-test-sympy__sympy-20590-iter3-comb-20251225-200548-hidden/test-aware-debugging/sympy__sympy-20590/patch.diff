Based on the problem statement and the reference test patch, we need to create a test that checks if the `__dict__` attribute exists for a `Symbol` instance. The test should fail if the attribute exists, as it should not be present according to the problem statement.

The test will be added to the `sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py` file, following the structure of the reference test patch. The test will create a `Symbol` instance and then check if the `__dict__` attribute exists using the `hasattr` function. If the attribute exists, the test should fail.

Here is the proposed test patch:

 The `.ta_split.json` file will be updated to include the new test in the `public` section:

+{
  "public": ["sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py::test_symbol_no_dict"],
  "hidden": []
+}
 This test should fail on the buggy code because the `__dict__` attribute exists when it should not. After the bug is fixed, the test should pass because the `__dict__` attribute will no longer exist.
