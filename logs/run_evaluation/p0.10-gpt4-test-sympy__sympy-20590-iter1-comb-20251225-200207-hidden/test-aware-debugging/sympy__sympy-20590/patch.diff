Based on the problem statement and the reference test patch, we need to create a test that checks if the `__dict__` attribute exists for a `Symbol` instance and if it can be modified. The test should fail if the `__dict__` attribute exists or can be modified, as `Symbol` instances are supposed to be immutable.

Here is the test diff:

 This test checks if the `__dict__` attribute exists for a `Symbol` instance and if it can be modified. The test should fail if the `__dict__` attribute exists or can be modified, as `Symbol` instances are supposed to be immutable. This test reproduces the bug described in the problem statement.
