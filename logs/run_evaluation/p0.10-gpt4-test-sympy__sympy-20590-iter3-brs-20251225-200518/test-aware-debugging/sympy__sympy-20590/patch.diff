 The `.ta_split.json` file will be updated to include the new test in the `public` section:
 
+{
  "public": ["sympy/core/tests/test_basic.py::test_symbol_no_dict"],
  "hidden": []

 This test should fail on the buggy code because the `__dict__` attribute exists when it should not. After the bug is fixed, the test should pass because the `__dict__` attribute will no longer exist.
